    <h1>Tags:</h1>
    <p> To make a new <bold> paragraph </b> you can either use the "p" tag or the "br" tag.  They are similar. 
    <br>The "br" tag stands for break.  Both tags are used to start the next line, but the "br" tag will just
    <br>make a new line, the "p" tag makes a new paragraph (skips a line)</br>  </p>
    <p>The "div" is used to divide your html document into blocks/areas. It is used with block level content. </p>
    <p>The h1" is used to make the first heading.  </p>
    <p>When you want to make an element <b> bold</b> you use the "b" tag.</p>
    <p> To <em> italicize</em> you use the "em" tag. </p>
    <p> The "span" tag is similar to the "div" tag-but there is a difference. </p>
    <P> The "span" tag is used with inline elements to group and apply styles.</p>
